# 📊 Excel Data Analysis Project

## 🧩 Overview  
This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data using **Microsoft Excel**.  
It highlights core Excel skills such as **data cleaning, formula logic, pivot tables, and dashboard design** — all applied to uncover key insights and create an interactive report.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation  
Steps I performed to make the data analysis-ready:
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
- Standardized inconsistent entries (dates, categories, text casing, etc.)  
- Applied **data validation** for controlled inputs  
- Used formulas like `IF()`, `VLOOKUP()`, `INDEX-MATCH`, and `TEXT()` to fix and transform data

## 📈 Pivot Tables & Analysis  
I used pivot tables to summarize and analyze the data efficiently:
- Created pivot tables to calculate totals, averages, and category breakdowns  
- Applied filters and slicers to make analysis dynamic  
- Highlighted key metrics and patterns using conditional formatting
